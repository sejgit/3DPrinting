# Summary

Initially designed for 11 piece Dremel EZ-Lock cutting kit storage/organization, so that the discs are protected. 

I wanted something to separate the different types of cutting discs (metal, plastic, thin cut), hold the mandrel, and I wanted it to be modular so it could grow with my needs. What is shown here is the first draft. 

There are two lid options (I prefer the version that isn't in the photos...version 2). 
I've also added some versions with "No Hole" which won't work if too close to the shaft, but allows these to be used for pure storage needs, unrelated to the Dremel EZ-Lock stuff if desired.


Designed to print with the male thread side on the build plate.

(NOTE: blue piece is an older design with longer thread, but found shorter thread was sufficient) 

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK3
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.1mm
Infill: Doesn't matter
Filament_brand: Cheapest I had ($8cad/kg I think)
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
Printed well with a 0.5mm nozzle. I could only print 1-2 parts at a time on my Prusa i3mk3, since the bed isn't very flat. 

# How I Designed This

## Based on basic Fusion 360 thread

Tried to keep it small and modular, so ended up basing it on ISO Metric M42x2 6g right hand thread in Fusion 360, 4mm thick. Everything else was based off of that.
