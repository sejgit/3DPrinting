# Summary

3D printed parts needed to build an airtight dry box for 3D printer filament storage. Full instructions can be found at this link to my How-To at [Instructables.com](http://www.instructables.com/id/Airtight-Dry-Box-for-3D-Printer-Filament/ "Airtight Dry Box for 3D Printer Filament").

The purpose of this dry box is to prevent printer filament from absorbing moisture in the air. It can be used for keeping filament spools of various sizes (up to ~10" [260mm] diameter) in long term storage and in active use. It also prevents dust and dirt from entering the print head by a foam filter. Lubrication can be added as well, as some people in the 3D printing community have suggested. The PTFE tubing is a nice benefit of this set up, even without a bowden style filament drive, as it prevents kinks and coils from stopping the print.

# Print Settings
