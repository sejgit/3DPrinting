# Summary

The Dyson V10 comes with 5 accessories, but can only hold 2.  This mount allows all 5 attachments to be stored with the base unit.

Both the Mini Soft Dusting Brush and the Mini Motorized Tool require more space from the wall.  The "Offset" version of each will provide that space.

You only need 1 "Right" and 1 "Left" stl.  If you are going to mount the Dusting Brush or Mini Motorized Tool, you'll need one of those two to be a "Offset" version.

Enjoy! :)

Note: I've only tested this with the V10, but it should work with the V7 and V8.

# How I Designed This

I designed this in Fusion360, and have included the Fusion360 file if anyone needs to modify for their needs.  You can also find at this link:
