# Summary

I designed this silica gel container mostly for two reasons:

1. I looked at several different silica gel containers and even printed a few but always found something I was not entirely happy with (I most likely didn't look at every single option there is though).
2. Designing stuff is just so much fun (something I actually didn't expect before I purchased my 3D printer)

These are the things I tried to achieve:

* The silica gel I bought consists of rather small pieces (especially when the pieces are broken). Therefore the gaps in the walls should be pretty narrow but still let a lot of air in. Slots seem to fit this requirement better than holes. To let even more air in I added a hole at the bottom that contains air slots as well.
* Opening it should be be quick and easy but it should be more or less impossible to be opened by accident. Something with a screwable lid seems the best choice for this.
* It should fit inside a filament spool.
* It should be easy to print and and don't require supports.
* It should be reasonably sturdy but don't waste too much filament.

There are three different variants (best seen in the second picture):

* NoCore - Regular container without hole in center
* HalfCore - Container with hole in center half way through
* FullCore - Container with hole in center all the way through (including lid)

Each variant comes in four different sizes. All have a diameter of 50mm. There heights (including the lid) are:

* 30mm
* 50mm
* 75mm
* 100mm

The lid is the same for all sizes. The FullCore variants have their own lid with a hole in the center.

To aid filling the FullCore variants with silica gel there also is a center plug and a screw on funnel.

__Updates__

_2019-04-20_:

* Changed threads on all containers and lids for better print results with layer heights > 0.15mm (tested up to 0.3mm)

_2019-04-01_:

* NoCore and FullCore variants have been added
* Funnel and Center Plug have been added
