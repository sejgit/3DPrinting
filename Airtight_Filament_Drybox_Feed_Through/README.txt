# Summary

This is a remix from awesome drybox designed by mcfada https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1359419

I made few changes to the original design because I find it quite hard to just rely on glue to adhere printed part on the drybox itself. So, I added two M4 screw holes on each part. Slot for M4 nut on the back side. This make installation much more secure and easier to align. Add few layers of glue between pieces would make it airtight as well.

Parts needed
1 x Pneumatic connector http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/nEqbqJI
2 x M4 12mm screw 
2 x M4 Nut
2 x M4 Washer

Useful tool
- Soldering gun to make holes on the drybox. I find this much easier than using a drill.
- Electric screwdriver

Note: M4 nut slots in V1.0 is designed to be tight fit but it maybe smaller than some M4 nuts, so you might need to use soldering gun to heat M4 nuts while pushing them to each hole. V1.1 doesn't need this process.

I use this in conjunction with this socket https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:743280

# Print Settings

Printer: AM8
Supports: Yes

Notes: 
Support is required for back part. I recommend to make M4 nut hole side facing up. This will make support removal much easier than another way round. I cut my finger once while I tried to punch support out from M4 nut slot lol

# How I Designed This

Fusion 360 from scratch.
