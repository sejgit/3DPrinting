# Summary

This is a through-hole screw mount for a [EEEkit Hygrometer](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BLY177S/) (Amazon link, non-affiliate). You can use this to mount a humidity sensor for readability outside a container, but with the sensor inside.

This was designed so I could easily view the humidity inside the sealed storage container which contains my filament.

You can easily snap the hygrometer into the "outer" casing; it'll hold tight as it has tabs on the inside. Is it a perfect seal? Definitely not, but it's not bad. I printed the casing in PETG.

Included are gaskets for the inner and outer; these were printed in TPE, so they're a little squishy.

The Fusion 360 `.f3d` is included in case you need to make any modifications. I'll attach photos later, once it's installed.

**Note:** There are two gaskets, which are _technically_ different size but well, there is no reason for them to be. They're interchangeable, and when printed the tenths of mm difference is irrelevant.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK3
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.20mm
Infill: 20%
Filament_brand: eSUN
Filament_color: Black

Notes: 
I printed this with an Archemedian Chord top/bottom fill pattern to have a really nice circular pattern all around. The infill was a 20% grid (sliced in Slic3r PE).

The gaskets were printed in eSUN "eLastic" TPE, also in black, and with an Archemedian Chord top/bottom fill.
