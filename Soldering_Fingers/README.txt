# Summary

While this isn't strictly a remix, I wanted to give "idig3d" credit for the inspiration. I created a soldering helping hands http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1635453 but when I saw idig3d's version, I liked the simplicity and faster build time. I thought I'd create one that was similar but had additional grooves and a tapered top. Here is my interpretation.

Note: In the pictures, it looks like it's floating a bit. That's because I put little adhesive rubber feet so it won't slide along my workspace while soldering. 

I have recently created this helping hands as well. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2757071

# Print Settings

Printer: Hatchbox delta
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.3mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
I think printing on a lower resolution in this case would be beneficial as it would create more friction to hold the wires. Sort of a built in saw tooth if you will.
