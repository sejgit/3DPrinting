# Summary

Prusa i3 MK3 heatbed cable cover for the heatbed version with soldered cables. This cover changes the orientation of the heatbed cable 60 deg clockwise to allow the printer to fit in an IKEA LACK cabinet (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2864118). It reduces the depth of the printer by about 25mm.

This thing was inspired by https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837970 but designed to solve its crucial problem of extruder wires crashing into the heatbed cover when extruding in the upper left corner. This problem was solved by making a cover with the same low profile as the original Prusa cable cover (https://www.prusa3d.com/prusa-i3-printable-parts/, which I also used for inspiration).

No modifications are required to heatbed/cables in order to fit this cover on the heatbed with soldered cables. I have not tested it on heatbed version with screw connectors.

You will need
- M3x10 screw (3x)
- M3n nut (3x)

to complete this modification (same as original Prusa cover).
