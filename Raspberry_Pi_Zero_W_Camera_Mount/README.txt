# Summary

A simple ball & socket articulated mount system designed to be used with medium size 3M Command Strips. Although the plate looks smaller than the Command Strip, it is designed to fit the adhesive area of the "red" side (not "wall" side) of the strip.

System was designed to provide a clean way to mount the new Raspberry Pi Zero W in it's new case as a camera. Sockets place enough tension on the joints to support a Raspberry Pi Zero's weight, but not a whole lot more.

Socket plate includes a small cable holder.
