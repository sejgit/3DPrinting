# Summary

There are lots of tool stands/holders out there but nothing that quite met my needs so I designed one using Fusion 360.  This stand holds lots of Wiha style micro drivers and nut drivers.  It also has slots for cutters and various size pliers.  There is a platform that I covered with a non-slip mat that is perfect for Exacto knives, tweezers, and other small items.  There is also 2 slots below the platform that is perfect for crimpers and wire strippers.

I printed this with PETG but I'm sure PLA would be fine too.  There are screw holds for M3 screws to mount the sides to the base and the outside holders to the sides.  The internal middle holders are glued to the sides and the crossbeams are press fit into the sides.

This turned out great for my use and I hope others find it useful too.
